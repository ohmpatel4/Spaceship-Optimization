# Spaceship-Optimization
Spaceship Optimization
This program demonstrates a root finding solution to an optimization problem involving getting a spacship as close to saturn as possible depending on the trajectory angle.
This program implements a function spaceshipderivative that estimates the derivative of the minimum
distance as a function of Î¸ according to the finite-difference approach.
This program then implements bisection method to find a single root of the function inside the given bracket.
